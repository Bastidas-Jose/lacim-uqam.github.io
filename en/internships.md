# Research Internships at LACIM

Every year, LACIM welcomes research interns who work closely with our members.
The working atmosphere in Montreal is dynamic, and all trainees are invited to
take part in the colloquia, workshops and seminars that are held regularly.

## Postdoctoral fellowships

If you are interested in a postdoctoral fellowship at LACIM, please apply for a
[CRM-ISM postdoctoral fellowship](https://www.crmath.ca/en/fellowships-and-visitors/crm-ism-postdoctoral-fellowships/)
