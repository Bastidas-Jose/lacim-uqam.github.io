research themes are rooted in combinatorics and its links to algebra and
computer science.
LACIM is also a [CRM research laboratory](https://www.crmath.ca) and the
[Canada Research Chair in Algebra, Combinatorics, and Mathematical Computer Science](https://recherche.uqam.ca/unites_de_recherche/chaire-de-recherche-du-canada-en-algebre-combinatoire-et-informatique-mathematique/)
is associated with LACIM.
