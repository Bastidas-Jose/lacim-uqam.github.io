    Comparing two biperfect bases using category O
  date: 2024-12-06
  abstract: >
    The apparently elementary question of writing down perfect bases for the
    finite dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple Lie algebras is
    a problem which finds its source in surprisingly involved mathematical
    tools. Two such sources are a version of the geometric Satake equivalence
    (giving rise to the so-called Mirkovic-Vilonen bases) and a categorification
    of $U_q^{-}$ using KLR algebras (giving rise to the so-called dual canonical
    bases). It has been shown that those two families of bases do not coincide,
    raising the question of understanding the change of basis matrix. Building
    upon the results of Kamnitzer-Tingley-Webster-Weekes-Yacobi, we show how one
    can use category O for truncated shifted Yangians to better understand the
    discrepancies between the bases. This is joint work with Joel Kamnitzer.

    Topology of real matroid Schubert varieties
  date: 2024-11-29
  abstract: >
    Every linear representation of a matroid determines a matroid Schubert
    variety whose geometry encodes combinatorics of the matroid. When the
    representation is over the real numbers, we study the topology of the real
    points of the variety. Our main tool is an explicit cell decomposition,
    which depends only on the oriented matroid structure and can be extended to
    define a combinatorially interesting topological space for any oriented
    matroid. This is joint work with Yu Li.

    The quasisymmetric flag variety and equivariant forest polynomials
  date: 2024-11-22
  abstract: >
    Schubert calculus transforms the intersection theory of the flag variety
    GL_n/B into a multiplication problem for combinatorial polynomials, while
    double Schubert calculus extends this to a torus-equivariant setting. Two
    essential components underlie these approaches: (1) a surjective
    homomorphism from an infinite polynomial ring F[x1, x2, …] to the
    (torus-equivariant) cohomology ring of GL_n/B, and (2) the existence of
    Schubert polynomials, a basis of F[x1, x2, …] that interacts naturally with
    the surjection from (1). This talk will describe a subvariety of GL_n/B that
    exhibits a surprisingly tight analogue of (1) and (2) with respect to a
    known basis of polynomials over Z and generalize this basis to the
    equivariant setting. I will show how these new objects can be analyzed
    using tools from algebraic combinatorics, such as noncrossing partitions and
    quasisymmetric polynomials, and speculate about how this can deepen our
    understanding of equivariant Schubert calculus. This is ongoing work with
    Nantel Bergeron, Philippe Nadeau, Hunter Spink, and Vasu Tewari.

        A combinatorial proof of an identity involving Eulerian numbers.
  date: 2024-11-15
  abstract: >
    In 2009, Brenti and Welker studied the Veronese construction for formal
    power series which was motivated by the corresponding construction for
    graded algebras. As a corollary of their algebraic computations, they
    discovered an identity for the coefficients of the Eulerian polynomials.

    The authors asked for a combinatorial proof of this identity given that all
    of its ingredients are enumerative in nature. In this talk I will present
    one such combinatorial proof using alcoved polytopes.

    Calculer la matrice de Cartan d'un monoïde en comptant des points fixes.
  date: 2024-11-08
  abstract: >
    [Thiéry '12] a donné une formule permettant de calculer la matrice de Cartan
    d'une algèbre de monoïde en fonction de sa table de caractère et du nombre
    de points fixes sous une action semblable à la conjugaison. Cet exposé
    discute la manière d'utiliser en pratique cette formule pour faire le calcul
    à l'ordinateur. En particulier, le comptage naïf de points fixes est trop
    inefficace pour être utilisé en pratique. Ce problème sera une excuse pour
    parler de la structure de la multiplication d'un monoïde : classes de Green,
    groupes aux idempotents et groupes de Schutzenberger, etc, et de voir
    comment exploiter cette structure permet compter efficacement des points
    fixes dans le monoïde. Dans un second temps on verra comment cette structure
    contrôle la théorie des représentations du monoïde et comment on peut à
    nouveau l'exploiter pour calculer l'autre élément nécessaire à la formule de
    Thiéry : la table de caractère.

    Descents for cones of a real hyperplane arrangement
  date: 2024-11-01
  abstract: >
    Reading a permutation from left to right and recording the positions where
    the values decrease yields the descent set of the permutation. More
    generally, descents may be attached to elements of a finite Coxeter group.
    In this talk we will discuss a different extension of the notion of
    descents, to the setting of real hyperplane arrangements. The notion on
    which this is based is the Tits product, an operation that exists on the set
    of faces of such an arrangement. The talk will center around this
    fundamental notion and include a discussion of faces, cones, and descents,
    together with lots of illustrations. No previous familiarity with hyperplane
    arrangements will be assumed.

    Random Combinatorial Billiards
  date: 2024-10-25
  abstract: >
    Combinatorial billiards is a new topic that concerns rigid and discretized
    billiard systems that can be modeled combinatorially or algebraically. I
    will introduce a random combinatorial billiard trajectory depending on some
    fixed probability p; when p tends to 0, it essentially recovers Thomas Lam's
    reduced random walk. This random billiard trajectory can also be interpreted
    as a random growth process on core partitions. The analysis of the random
    billiard trajectory relies on new finite Markov chains called stoned
    exclusion processes, which are variants of certain interacting particle
    systems. These processes have remarkable stationary distributions determined
    by well-studied polynomials such as ASEP polynomials, inhomogeneous TASEP
    polynomials, and open boundary ASEP polynomials; in many cases, it was
    previously not known how to construct Markov chains with these stationary
    distributions.

    Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra
  date: 2024-10-11
  abstract: >
    The eigenvalues of a Markov chain determine its mixing time. In this talk, I
    will describe a Markov chain on the symmetric group called random-to-random
    shuffling whose eigenvalues have surprisingly elegant—though
    mysterious—formulas. In particular, these eigenvalues were shown to be
    non-negative integers by Dieker and Saliola in 2017, resolving an almost 20
    year conjecture.

    In recent work with Ilani Axelrod-Freed, Judy Chiang, Patricia Commins and
    Veronica Lang, we generalize random-to-random shuffling to a Markov chain on
    the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and prove combinatorial expressions for
    its eigenvalues as a polynomial in q with non-negative integer coefficients.
    Our methods simplify the existing proof for q=1 by drawing novel connections
    between random-to-random shuffling and the Jucys-Murphy elements of the
    Hecke algebra.

    Beyond weak order on the affine symmetric group
  date: 2024-10-04
  abstract: >
    We will generalize many facts about the weak order on a finite Coxeter group
    to the _extended weak order_ on an affine Weyl group. Whereas the weak order
    is the poset of regions in the Coxeter arrangement, the extended weak order
    is the poset of _quasiregions_.  Quasiregions include regions, but for
    infinite Coxeter group they also include more exotic objects (equivalent to
    _biclosed sets_ of positive roots). 
    
    For instance, in type $\widetilde{A}$, quasiregions are equivalent to
    translation-invariant total orderings of the integers (TITOs). In type
    $\widetilde{A}$, the extended weak order is a lattice, while the weak order
    is not. We show that, in this case, the extended weak order is a lattice
    quotient of the lattice of torsion classes for a type $\widetilde{A}$
    preprojective algebra. We also introduce the affine Tamari lattice, which is
    the poset of $312$-avoiding TITOs, and show how it describes a cluster
    algebra for the oriented cycle quiver.

    Diagram calculus for affine Temperley–Lieb algebra of type D
  date: 2024-09-27
  abstract: >
    The Temperley—Lieb algebra is a classical mathematical object studied in
    algebra, combinatorics, statistical mechanics and mathematical physics,
    introduced by Temperley and Lieb in 1971.

    For any Coxeter system, it is possible to define the so-called generalized
    Temperley—Lieb algebras as quotients of the associated Hecke algebras.
    Moreover, beginning with the work of Kauffman and Penrose, it was shown
    that most Temperley—Lieb algebras can be realized as diagram algebras,
    which are associative algebras with a basis given by certain diagrams on
    the plane.

    In this talk, I will introduce a diagrammatic representation for the
    Temperley—Lieb algebra of type affine D, obtained using particular
    decorated diagrams. I will also describe some of the combinatorial
    strategies used to prove the faithfulness of this representation.

    A journey on configuration graphs
  date: 2024-09-20
  abstract: >
    Configuration graphs are "meta-graphs" where vertices are solutions of a
    problem and two solutions are linked by an edge if one can be transformed
    into the other into a "canonical" step. These questions naturally arise in
    many fields from discrete geometry to combinatorial optimization.

    The goal of this introductory talk is to present (some of) these problems
    and their motivations, discuss some recent results on the topic and
    mention some open problems in the area.

    What is beyond D-finite?
  date: 2024-09-13
  abstract: >
    As classes of GFs go, we tend to know more about smaller classes than larger
    ones, think of the progression from rational to algebraic to D-finite to
    D-algebraic GFs.  The positivity adds another twist on these classes, bringing
    a host of new problems.  In this talk, I will review some classes of GFs that
    are of interest in Enumerative Combinatorics but remain understudied,
    emphasising both larger classes and positivity properties.

    Cyclically ordered quivers
  date: 2024-09-06
  abstract: >
    Quivers and their mutations play a fundamental role in the theory of cluster
    algebras. We focus on the problem of deciding whether two given quivers are
    mutation equivalent to each other. Our approach is based on introducing an
    additional structure of a cyclic ordering on the set of vertices of a quiver.
    This leads to new powerful invariants of quiver mutation. These invariants
    can be used to show that various quivers are not mutation acyclic, i.e., they
    are not mutation equivalent to an acyclic quiver. This talk is partially
    based on joint work with Sergey Fomin [arXiv:2406.03604]
