    What is beyond D-finite?
  date: 2024-09-13
  abstract: >
    As classes of GFs go, we tend to know more about smaller classes than larger
    ones, think of the progression from rational to algebraic to D-finite to
    D-algebraic GFs.  The positivity adds another twist on these classes, bringing
    a host of new problems.  In this talk, I will review some classes of GFs that
    are of interest in Enumerative Combinatorics but remain understudied,
    emphasising both larger classes and positivity properties.

    Cyclically ordered quivers
  date: 2024-09-06
  abstract: > 
    Quivers and their mutations play a fundamental role in the theory of cluster
    algebras. We focus on the problem of deciding whether two given quivers are
    mutation equivalent to each other. Our approach is based on introducing an
    additional structure of a cyclic ordering on the set of vertices of a quiver.
    This leads to new powerful invariants of quiver mutation. These invariants
    can be used to show that various quivers are not mutation acyclic, i.e., they
    are not mutation equivalent to an acyclic quiver. This talk is partially
    based on joint work with Sergey Fomin [arXiv:2406.03604]

  title: An introduction to persistence theory
  date: 2024-06-28
  abstract: >
    Persistence theory was born from the observation that the critical values
    of a Morse function admit a canonical pairing, which induces a direct sum
    decomposition of the sublevel set homology of the function into interval
    poset representations. What makes persistence theory distinct from Morse
    theory - besides the fact that it is usually framed using the language of
    representation theory - is its focus on perturbation-stability, providing
    answers to questions such as: How can the critical values of a Morse
    function change when the function is perturbed? The initial motivation for
    the study of perturbation-stability came from problems in geometric data
    science, but has since found applications in symplectic geometry as well as
    in complex and functional analysis. I will give an overview of the
    representation theoretic and combinatorial aspects of persistence theory,
    including motivation and applications.

    Beyond twisted maps: crepant resolutions of log terminal singularities and
    a motivic McKay correspondence
  date: 2024-06-21 <br> <em>à 15h</em>
  abstract: >
    Crepant resolutions have inspired connections between birational geometry,
    derived categories, representation theory, and motivic integration. In this
    talk, we prove that every variety with log-terminal singularities admits a
    crepant resolution by a smooth stack. We additionally prove a motivic McKay
    correspondence for stack-theoretic resolutions. Finally, we show how our
    work naturally leads to a generalization of twisted mapping spaces. This is
    joint work with Jeremy Usatine.

  title: Énumération de polyominos dans un rectangle $b$ x $h$
  date: 2024-06-14
  abstract: >
    Dans cet exposé, on s'attaque à un sous-problème de l'énumeration des
    polyominos qui est un problème étudié depuis son introduction par Goulomb.
    On énumère les polyominos qui sont inscrits dans un rectangle d'une
    certaine taille. Si on fixe la base $b$ et varie la hauteur, le nombre de
    polyominos inscrits dans ces rectangles suit une récurrence linéaire.
    L'objectif est de construire des automates qui reconnaissent ces polyominos
    pour obtenir les séries génératrice.
    En adaptant des méthodes décrites dans des travaux de Zeilberger et de
    Bousquet-Mélou et Brak, on développe une construction systématique de ces
    automates pour chaque valeur de $b$.

  title: Demazure Models of Algebraic Tori
  date: 2024-05-31
  abstract: >
    For a field \(k\), algebraic \(k\)-tori are algebraic \(k\)-groups which
    become isomorphic to a split \(k\)-torus, after base change to the
    separable closure of \(k\). The possible algebraic \(k\)-tori of dimension
    n are classified up to isomorphism by  finite subgroups of \(GL(n,Z)\) up
    to conjugacy and hence by integral representations of finite groups. Work
    of Demazure, Voskresenskii and Klyachko, among others, established, in
    principle, the existence of a smooth projective model of an algebraic
    \(k\)-torus which was used to determine its birational properties.
    Kunyavskii’s birational classification of algebraic \(k\)-tori in dimension
    \(3\) involved constructions of smooth projective toric models of the
    algebraic tori corresponding to maximal finite subgroups of \(GL(3,Z)\). We
    discuss some explicit constructions of toric models of algebraic tori,
    making connections with the defining integral representations of their
    splitting groups.  The constructions determine smooth projective toric
    models of the algebraic tori corresponding to maximal finite subgroups of
    \(GL(4,Z)\). Since projective toric varieties are determined by lattice
    polytopes, our constructions focus on some highly symmetric families of
    polytopes, such as root polytopes and duals of central transportation
    polytopes.

  title: The descent algebra, the braid arrangement, and extensions to left regular bands
  date: 2024-05-24
  abstract: >
    The faces of the braid arrangement form a monoid. The associated monoid
    algebra -- the face algebra -- is well-studied, especially in relation to
    Markov chains. In this talk, we explore the action of the symmetric group on
    the face algebra from the perspective of invariant theory. Bidigare proved
    the invariant subalgebra of the face algebra is (anti)isomorphic to Solomon's
    descent algebra. We answer the more general question: what is the structure
    of the face algebra as a simultaneous representation of the symmetric group
    and Solomon's descent algebra? A key tool in answering this question is the
    poset topology of the partition lattice. We will say a bit about how poset
    topology can be applied to a more general setting: groups acting on left
    regular band algebras.

  title: Combinatorics of Hilbert Schur algebras
  date: 2024-05-17
  abstract: >
    The Schur algebra is a finite dimensional algebra that connects the
    representation theory of symmetric and general linear groups.  In joint
    work with Tom Braden we introduce new algebra that enhances the Schur
    algebra and provides a new window into the representation theory of
    symmetric groups.  I will give a conceptual and a diagrammatic description
    of this new “Hilbert Schur algebra" and discuss some of its combinatorial
    structure.

  title: Une symétrie des mots de Christoffel
  date: 2024-04-12
  abstract: >
    Dans le cadre de l’étude des mots trapézoïdaux, dont la séquence de la
    cardinalité des facteurs est symétrique, on introduit une variance bivariée
    qui reflète cette symétrie dans l’image commutative des facteurs,
    caractérisant ainsi, sous certaines hypothèses, les mots de Christoffel.
    Bien que le cas primitif soit contraint aux mots sturmiens, le cas
    non-primitif se départie de cette hypothèse et, ce faisant, caractérise
    parfaitement les mots de Christoffel.

  title: Skewing formulas and a geometric interpretation for the Delta conjecture
  date: 2024-04-05
  abstract: >
    We show a skewing relation holds between the symmetric functions involved
    in the Rational Shuffle Conjecture and those of the Delta Conjecture, and
    use it to derive a geometric interpretation for the Delta polynomials in
    terms of the Borel-Moore homology of certain affine Springer fibers.  Our
    geometric work simultaneously generalizes that of Hikita and
    Borho--Macpherson from two special cases, and our algebraic proof of the
    skewing relation relies on the new work of Blasiak, Haiman, Morse, Pun, and
    Seelinger that resolved the "Rise" half of the Delta Conjecture.  We also
    note some progress towards a purely combinatorial proof of the relation.
    This is joint work with Sean Griffin and Eugene Gorsky.
