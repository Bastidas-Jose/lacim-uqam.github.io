    Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra
  date: 2024-10-11
  abstract: >
    The eigenvalues of a Markov chain determine its mixing time. In this talk, I
    will describe a Markov chain on the symmetric group called random-to-random
    shuffling whose eigenvalues have surprisingly elegant—though
    mysterious—formulas. In particular, these eigenvalues were shown to be
    non-negative integers by Dieker and Saliola in 2017, resolving an almost 20
    year conjecture.

    In recent work with Ilani Axelrod-Freed, Judy Chiang, Patricia Commins and
    Veronica Lang, we generalize random-to-random shuffling to a Markov chain on
    the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and prove combinatorial expressions for
    its eigenvalues as a polynomial in q with non-negative integer coefficients.
    Our methods simplify the existing proof for q=1 by drawing novel connections
    between random-to-random shuffling and the Jucys-Murphy elements of the
    Hecke algebra.

    Beyond weak order on the affine symmetric group
  date: 2024-10-04
  abstract: >
    We will generalize many facts about the weak order on a finite Coxeter group
    to the _extended weak order_ on an affine Weyl group. Whereas the weak order
    is the poset of regions in the Coxeter arrangement, the extended weak order
    is the poset of _quasiregions_.  Quasiregions include regions, but for
    infinite Coxeter group they also include more exotic objects (equivalent to
    _biclosed sets_ of positive roots). 
    
    For instance, in type $\widetilde{A}$, quasiregions are equivalent to
    translation-invariant total orderings of the integers (TITOs). In type
    $\widetilde{A}$, the extended weak order is a lattice, while the weak order
    is not. We show that, in this case, the extended weak order is a lattice
    quotient of the lattice of torsion classes for a type $\widetilde{A}$
    preprojective algebra. We also introduce the affine Tamari lattice, which is
    the poset of $312$-avoiding TITOs, and show how it describes a cluster
    algebra for the oriented cycle quiver.

    Diagram calculus for affine Temperley–Lieb algebra of type D
  date: 2024-09-27
  abstract: >
    The Temperley—Lieb algebra is a classical mathematical object studied in
    algebra, combinatorics, statistical mechanics and mathematical physics,
    introduced by Temperley and Lieb in 1971.

    For any Coxeter system, it is possible to define the so-called generalized
    Temperley—Lieb algebras as quotients of the associated Hecke algebras.
    Moreover, beginning with the work of Kauffman and Penrose, it was shown
    that most Temperley—Lieb algebras can be realized as diagram algebras,
    which are associative algebras with a basis given by certain diagrams on
    the plane.

    In this talk, I will introduce a diagrammatic representation for the
    Temperley—Lieb algebra of type affine D, obtained using particular
    decorated diagrams. I will also describe some of the combinatorial
    strategies used to prove the faithfulness of this representation.

    A journey on configuration graphs
  date: 2024-09-20
  abstract: >
    Configuration graphs are "meta-graphs" where vertices are solutions of a
    problem and two solutions are linked by an edge if one can be transformed
    into the other into a "canonical" step. These questions naturally arise in
    many fields from discrete geometry to combinatorial optimization.

    The goal of this introductory talk is to present (some of) these problems
    and their motivations, discuss some recent results on the topic and
    mention some open problems in the area.

    What is beyond D-finite?
  date: 2024-09-13
  abstract: >
    As classes of GFs go, we tend to know more about smaller classes than larger
    ones, think of the progression from rational to algebraic to D-finite to
    D-algebraic GFs.  The positivity adds another twist on these classes, bringing
    a host of new problems.  In this talk, I will review some classes of GFs that
    are of interest in Enumerative Combinatorics but remain understudied,
    emphasising both larger classes and positivity properties.

    Cyclically ordered quivers
  date: 2024-09-06
  abstract: >
    Quivers and their mutations play a fundamental role in the theory of cluster
    algebras. We focus on the problem of deciding whether two given quivers are
    mutation equivalent to each other. Our approach is based on introducing an
    additional structure of a cyclic ordering on the set of vertices of a quiver.
    This leads to new powerful invariants of quiver mutation. These invariants
    can be used to show that various quivers are not mutation acyclic, i.e., they
    are not mutation equivalent to an acyclic quiver. This talk is partially
    based on joint work with Sergey Fomin [arXiv:2406.03604]
