    What is beyond D-finite?
  date: 2024-09-13
  abstract: >
    As classes of GFs go, we tend to know more about smaller classes than larger
    ones, think of the progression from rational to algebraic to D-finite to
    D-algebraic GFs.  The positivity adds another twist on these classes, bringing
    a host of new problems.  In this talk, I will review some classes of GFs that
    are of interest in Enumerative Combinatorics but remain understudied,
    emphasising both larger classes and positivity properties.

    Cyclically ordered quivers
  date: 2024-09-06
  abstract: >
    Quivers and their mutations play a fundamental role in the theory of cluster
    algebras. We focus on the problem of deciding whether two given quivers are
    mutation equivalent to each other. Our approach is based on introducing an
    additional structure of a cyclic ordering on the set of vertices of a quiver.
    This leads to new powerful invariants of quiver mutation. These invariants
    can be used to show that various quivers are not mutation acyclic, i.e., they
    are not mutation equivalent to an acyclic quiver. This talk is partially
    based on joint work with Sergey Fomin [arXiv:2406.03604]
